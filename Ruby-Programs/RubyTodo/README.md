# Ruby Todo

Uses Ruby 3.0.2, reverse compatible with Ruby 2.x

## Features

- Save todos persistently in a database
- Manage a simple implementation of user sessions
- Uses concepts like modularization, using dbs with raw ruby, etc that will help learners better approach the Ruby on Rails framework later

Happy Hacking
